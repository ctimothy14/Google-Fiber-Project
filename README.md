# Google Fiber Dashboard
The final part of the Google Business Intelligence Certificate was to complete a capstone project.

The Google Fiber Call Centre Team have requested me to develop a dashboard that allows them to explore trends in repeat calls.
The team needs to understand how often customers call customer support after their first inquiry. This will help leadership understand how effectively the team can answer customer questions the first time.

The data provided has been anonymized and approved by the Google Fiber Call Center team which includes:
- Number of calls
- Number of repeat calls after first contact
- Call type
- Market city
- Date

In order to anonymize the data, the datasets the columns market_1, market_2, and market_3 to indicate three different city service areas the data represents. 
The data also lists five problem types:
- Type_1 is account management
- Type_2 is technician troubleshooting
- Type_3 is scheduling
- Type_4 is construction
- Type_5 is internet and wifi

## Project goal:
- Understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time
- Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls.
- Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities.
- Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.

## Deliverables and metrics:
The dashboard which I have created will provide further insights and answer the following questions for the Google Fiber team:
- Help them understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time.
- Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls.
- Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities.
- Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.
